# BH-PoE-Lootfilter

 BullHorn's STRICT loot filter for Path of Exile - Essence League (2.4)

 Script edited with Filtration - https://github.com/ben-wallis/Filtration
 
 Leveling section was taken directly from NeverSink/Antnee filter - https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/NeverSink-Filter

 This filter is designed for the END-GAME and will hide most of the loot
 However, it still shows many things that might not be wanted at late-endgame, 
 like wisdom/portal/trans/aug, alt/chrome, jew/chance/glassblower, 
 chrome/chisel/glassblower recipe, chance bases and dumpster divination cards.
 If these things are unwanted, feel free to edit the filter to your liking.
