# BH-PoE-Lootfilter

BullHorn's STRICT loot filter for Path of Exile - Essence League (2.4)

Script edited with Filtration - https://github.com/ben-wallis/Filtration
 
Leveling section was taken directly from NeverSink/Antnee filter - https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/NeverSink-Filter https://gist.github.com/Antnee83

This filter is designed for leveling and endgame without seeing all the trash you normally see. However, it still shows many things that might not be wanted at late-endgame, like wisdom/portal/trans/aug, alt/chrome, jew/chance/glassblower, chrome/chisel/glassblower recipe, chance bases, dumpster divination cards and semi-transparent bad base rare items.
If these things are unwanted, feel free to edit the filter to your liking (which is rather simple, by switching the "Show" to "Hide" in the relevant section).
