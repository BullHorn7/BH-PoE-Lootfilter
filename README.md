# BullHorn's STRICT Path of Exile loot filter

---

## DESCRIPTION

This filter is designed for leveling and endgame without seeing all the trash you normally see. However, it still shows many things that might not be wanted at late-endgame, like wisdom/portal/trans/aug, alt/chrome, jew/chance/glassblower, chance bases and dumpster divination cards.
If these things are unwanted, feel free to edit the filter to your liking.

#### KEY FEATURES

* Highlights all items that are worth picking up with size/sound/color
* Includes NeverSink's and Antnee's leveling sections
* Highlights good ilvl 83+ bases and the new end-game bases introduced with the Essence league
* Procedural highlighting of some recipes
* Precedural hiding of bad items
* Hiding non-Vaal and non-Quality quest-reward gems
