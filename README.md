# BH-PoE-Lootfilter

BullHorn's STRICT loot filter for Path of Exile - Essence League (2.4)

Script edited with Filtration - https://github.com/ben-wallis/Filtration
 
Leveling section was taken directly from NeverSink/Antnee filter - https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/NeverSink-Filter https://gist.github.com/Antnee83

This filter is designed for leveling and endgame without seeing all the trash you normally see. However, it still shows many things that might not be wanted at late-endgame, like wisdom/portal/trans/aug, alt/chrome, jew/chance/glassblower, chance bases and dumpster divination cards.
If these things are unwanted, feel free to edit the filter to your liking.
